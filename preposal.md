# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

online closet - outfit generator based on the weather (and other criteria)
matching game

mad libs generator 
maze generator - creates a random maze that the user has to solve
book recommendation website
website that generates instagram comments/captions


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Taznuba Hossain

## Do you have any questions of your own?
Is there any way for me to make an iOS app using a Windows computer? 
I think the online closet idea would work best in app form, although a website is doable
