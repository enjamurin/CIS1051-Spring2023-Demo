# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

OOTD: Outfit Generator
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website/app that lets you upload pictures of items from your closet and will sort those items based on criteria like the weather or number of times worn. It will also generate outfit ideas based on specified criteria.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This website/app will allow the user to upload pictures items of clothing from their closet and then tag them with different descriptors from the drop down. 
The project will then generate outfits that users can like or dislike (to generate another outfit) and then save those fits to "closets" that the user creates (ex: Work, Date Night, Europe Trip)
It can also sort items by number of items worn, fabrics, styles etc. and generate outfits based on the weather (location inputted by user).

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable. N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Allowing the user to upload images and save images to certain "closets"/files.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition, being able to add tags/descriptors to the images and then having the system sort items based on those images.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition, adding a weather widget, having the system generate recommendations based on the weather or other descriptors such as style or event.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To develop this website, we would start by identifying the components that would be required, including: creating a website that stores user data, a function for the user to upload images, a tagging system that allows the user to assign different descriptors to the items, an algorithm that takes into account different criteria such as weather, and a for the user to create and save their own closets.

We would need to acquire a working knowledge of other languages, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We would also need to learn frameworks in Python and SQL. In addition, we would need to research various APIs that would provide weather data based on location.

We plan on dividing our tasks based on individual strenghts, where one person can be responsible for the front end design and implementation, while the other can focus on database management. 
However, we would both work together to ensure all components of the project are working correctly.
